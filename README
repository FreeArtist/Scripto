Scripto is an open source documentary transcription tool written in PHP. It 
features a lightweight library that interfaces MediaWiki and potentially any 
content management system that serves document images. MediaWiki is a good 
choice for the transcription database for several reasons:
  * It is the most popular wiki application and had a sizable and active 
    developer community.
  * Wiki markup is relatively easy to learn and there are useful WYSIWYG editors 
    available.
  * It offers helpful features, such as discussion pages and user 
    administration. 
  * It comes with a powerful, fully-featured API.

Requirements:
  * PHP 5.2.4+
  * Zend Framework 1.10+
  * MediaWiki 1.15.4+
  * Custom adapter interface to (and possibly an API for) the external CMS

Installation:
  * Download and install MediaWiki
  * Download the Zend Framework library
  * Download Scripto library, set the required configuration, and use the 
    Scripto library API to build your documentary transcription application.
